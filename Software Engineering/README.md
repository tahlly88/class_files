### Pac-Man UI and Options

##### GUI

- The GUI and options menu were entirely coded by me.
- I also implemented the code for the number of players, ghosts, and speed (difficulty), although the bug from the speed was corrected by a fellow classmate.



##### The original source used is from the MASON project. All I added was the Options GUI and the code to do what the GUI offers. 



- A hidden feature exists in the game that is accessible by selecting the hidden buttons in the Options menu while having it on 1 player, 3 ghosts, and hard difficulty.
